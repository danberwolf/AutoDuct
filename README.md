# AutoDuct

AutoDuct is a smart DIY air duct cover for decentralized ventilation systems in residential buildings. Its main purpose is to automatically control airflow and block outside noise using a 3D-printed shutter system. This prevents unintended air flow into the apartment during cold and windy days to increase comfort and energy efficiency.
